## Trying balenaSDK in the browser

BalenaSDK is widely utilized in the [balenaCloud dashboard](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/) to perform operations. The SDK has been made available in the browser console by default to test balenaSDK queries on the go. 
To use it, head to the [balenaCloud dashboard](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/) and open the [browser developer console](https://support.monday.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002197259-How-to-Open-the-Developer-Console). There, you will find balenaSDK initialized in the console and ready to run SDK queries.
